# Scrapbox ChatGPT Connector

The Scrapbox ChatGPT Connector is a simple script for connecting Scrapbox and ChatGPT.

The script is designed so that developers can easily grasp the big picture and customize it to their own needs. Also, the purpose of the project is to show a simple implementation, not to satisfy a wide variety of needs. I encourage everyone to understand the source code and customize it to their own needs.
